            <p>Plagiarism is treated seriourly. If we suspect any work is copied, all students involved are likely to receive zero 
                for the entire assignment. Plagarism has led to students being expelled from the University.

            <p>We know that life isn't perfect and there may be a time when you can't hand in an assignment on time, or make it
                to class or an exam. If you find yourself in a situation like this, you may be eligible for Academic Consideration. 
                Academic Consideration is designed to help students when they are sick, injured or where a serious, unplanned 
                situation has occurred that has affected their ability to study.
